- Need to implement NetworkX-compatible format

## Implementation Notes
### Graph Storage
- Base trait defined with initialize/finalize
- Core data structures implemented:
  - NodeData with ID and attributes
  - EdgeData with weight and metadata
- Current focus:
  - GraphML support implementation
  - NetworkX compatibility
  - Visualization support
- Design decisions:
  - Single efficient implementation vs multiple backends
  - Strong typing for better safety
  - Focus on memory optimization
  - Native performance through Rust

## General Notes
- Project started on [Current Date]
- Initial focus on core infrastructure
- Mobile optimization is a key priority

## Node Embedding Implementation Progress

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Base node2vec implementation
  - Core embedding generation functionality
  - Configuration options (dimensions, walk length, etc.)
  - Integration with graph storage
  - Basic test coverage
  - Default configuration settings

### In Progress üü°
- GraphML support
  - Reading functionality
  - Writing functionality
  - Attribute handling
  - NetworkX compatibility

### Next Steps üìã
1. Implement GraphML handler
2. Add attribute support
