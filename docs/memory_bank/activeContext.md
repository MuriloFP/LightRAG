## Current Task
Moving on to Content Processing:
- [ ] Implement content cleaning utilities
- [ ] Add content validation
- [ ] Create content summary generation
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement content deduplication

## Implementation Plan
1. ✓ Create chunking module structure
2. ✓ Implement core types
3. ✓ Add tiktoken integration
4. ✓ Implement chunking logic
5. ✓ Add tests
6. Document Format Support implementation:
   - ✓ Create format handling module
   - ✓ Implement format detection
   - ✓ Add text/markdown support
   - ✓ Add PDF support
   - ✓ Add Word support
   - ✓ Complete format-specific tests

## Test Coverage
1. ✓ Basic token-based chunking
2. ✓ Character-based splitting
3. ✓ Empty input handling
4. ✓ Error cases
5. ✓ Edge cases (large chunks, overlaps)
6. Format handling:
   - ✓ Format detection
   - ✓ Text file handling
   - ✓ Markdown handling
   - ✓ PDF handling
   - ✓ Word doc handling

## Dependencies
- ✓ tiktoken-rs
- ✓ serde
- ✓ tracing
- ✓ pdf-extract
- ✓ docx

## Important Notes
- Chunking implementation matches LightRAG's functionality
