# Current Status
Graph Storage Implementation - GraphML Support Complete

## Current Focus
Enhancing graph stabilization, improving node embedding integration, and refining GraphML handler error handling and logging

## Recent Changes
- Implemented node parsing functionality
- Implemented edge parsing functionality
- Added key definitions for node and edge attributes
- Implemented node writing functionality
- Implemented edge writing functionality
- Added proper quoting and formatting to match LightRAG's format
- Removed petgraph-graphml dependency in favor of custom implementation
- Added comprehensive test suite for GraphML functionality
- Added proper error handling for empty/invalid files
- Added XML entity escaping and unescaping
- Added support for complex attributes
- Added NetworkX compatibility
- Completed all GraphML tests successfully

## Current Task
Apply enhancements to core graph functionalities:
- Update stabilize_graph with detailed logging and consistency checks for sorted order
- Improve node embedding integration by refining the embedding algorithms dictionary and modularizing algorithm support
- Refine the GraphML handler to add extra error checks (e.g., verifying '<graphml' tag) and enhanced logging
(Postpone visualization support until these enhancements are verified)

## Implementation Plan
1. ✓ Create GraphML handler module
2. ✓ Implement node parsing
3. ✓ Implement edge parsing
4. ✓ Implement key definitions
5. ✓ Implement node writing
6. ✓ Implement edge writing
7. ✓ Add tests for GraphML roundtrip
8. ✓ Integrate with PetgraphStorage
9. Next: Enhance stabilization, node embedding integration, and GraphML error handling

## Test Coverage
1. ✓ Basic GraphML roundtrip
2. ✓ Pretty printing options
3. ✓ Complex attribute handling
4. ✓ Error handling
5. ✓ Large graph performance
6. ✓ Special character handling
7. ✓ NetworkX compatibility

## Dependencies
- ✓ petgraph
- ✓ quick-xml (with serialize feature)
- ✓ serde

## Important Notes
- Custom GraphML implementation provides full control over format
- All string values in GraphML are properly quoted
- Node and edge IDs follow LightRAG's format
- Keywords are comma-separated in edge data
- Weight is stored as a double value
- Proper error handling is implemented for all operations
- Comprehensive test suite ensures format compatibility
- NetworkX compatibility achieved

## Next Steps
1. Enhance graph stabilization:
   - Update stabilize_graph to log node/edge counts before and after stabilization
   - Add debug assertions for sorted order consistency
2. Improve node embedding integration:
   - Refine and modularize the embedding algorithms dictionary
   - Prepare for adding more algorithms in the future
3. Refine GraphML handler:
   - Add error checks (e.g., ensure file contains "<graphml") and enhanced logging
4. Once these enhancements are verified, revisit visualization support and performance optimizations
