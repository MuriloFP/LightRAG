# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing and enhancing the summary module for text processing.

### Recent Changes
1. Created `summary.rs` module with core functionality:
   - Implemented `SummaryError` for error handling
   - Added `SummaryType` enum for different summary types
   - Created `SummaryConfig` for configurable parameters
   - Implemented `SummaryMetadata` for tracking summary statistics
   - Added `ContentSummarizer` trait for extensibility
   - Implemented `BasicSummarizer` with truncation and token-based summaries

2. Enhanced token-based summarization:
   - Integrated tiktoken-rs for proper tokenization
   - Improved token counting and metadata
   - Added support for configurable token limits
   - Implemented smart token-based text splitting

3. Added comprehensive test coverage:
   - Unit tests for truncation summary
   - Unit tests for token-based summary
   - Edge case handling tests
   - Metadata verification tests

4. Implemented keyword extraction:
   - Added `KeywordExtractor` trait
   - Implemented `BasicKeywordExtractor` with TF-IDF
   - Added `LLMKeywordExtractor` for future LLM integration
   - Added conversation history support
   - Added metadata tracking
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

### Next Steps
1. Implement LLM integration:
   - Design LLM-based summarizer interface
   - Add configuration for LLM parameters
   - Implement prompt templates

2. Enhance metadata generation:
   - Add token distribution statistics
   - Include readability metrics
   - Track important entities

3. Prepare for LLM integration:
   - Design LLM-based summarizer interface
   - Add configuration for LLM parameters
   - Implement prompt templates

### Current Focus
- LLM integration for keyword extraction
- Metadata enrichment
- Test coverage maintenance

### Notes
- Token-based summary shows good results with tiktoken
- TF-IDF keyword extraction provides good baseline
- Need to consider multi-language support in the future
- Consider adding caching for tokenization results
