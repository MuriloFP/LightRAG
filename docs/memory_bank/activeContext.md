# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing and enhancing the summary module for text processing.

### Recent Changes
1. Created `summary.rs` module with core functionality:
   - Implemented `SummaryError` for error handling
   - Added `SummaryType` enum for different summary types
   - Created `SummaryConfig` for configurable parameters
   - Implemented `SummaryMetadata` for tracking summary statistics
   - Added `ContentSummarizer` trait for extensibility
   - Implemented `BasicSummarizer` with truncation and token-based summaries

2. Enhanced token-based summarization:
   - Integrated tiktoken-rs for proper tokenization
   - Improved token counting and metadata
   - Added support for configurable token limits
   - Implemented smart token-based text splitting

3. Added comprehensive test coverage:
   - Unit tests for truncation summary
   - Unit tests for token-based summary
   - Edge case handling tests
   - Metadata verification tests

4. Implemented keyword extraction:
   - Added `KeywordExtractor` trait
   - Implemented `BasicKeywordExtractor` with TF-IDF
   - Added `LLMKeywordExtractor` for future LLM integration
   - Added conversation history support
   - Added metadata tracking
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

### Next Steps
1. Implement LLM integration:
   - Design LLM-based summarizer interface
   - Add configuration for LLM parameters
   - Implement prompt templates

2. Enhance metadata generation:
   - Add token distribution statistics
   - Include readability metrics
   - Track important entities

3. Prepare for LLM integration:
   - Design LLM-based summarizer interface
   - Add configuration for LLM parameters
   - Implement prompt templates

### Current Focus
Implementing rate limiting and enhancing the caching system for both LLM and embedding providers.

### Notes
- Token-based summary shows good results with tiktoken
- TF-IDF keyword extraction provides good baseline
- Need to consider multi-language support in the future
- Consider adding caching for tokenization results

## Recent Changes

### Rate Limiting Implementation
1. Added rate limiting configuration to both LLM and embedding providers
2. Implemented token bucket algorithm for token-based rate limiting
3. Implemented sliding window algorithm for request-based rate limiting
4. Added concurrent request limiting with RAII guard
5. Integrated rate limiting with OpenAI and Ollama providers

### Caching System Enhancements
1. Enhanced cache with similarity-based matching using cosine similarity
2. Added configurable similarity thresholds
3. Improved cache eviction strategies
4. Added TTL and size-based limits
5. Integrated similarity-based caching with embedding providers

## Next Steps

### Distributed Cache Support
1. Research Redis integration options
2. Design distributed cache architecture
3. Implement cache synchronization
4. Add distributed locking mechanism

### Cache Invalidation
1. Design invalidation strategies
2. Implement time-based invalidation
3. Add event-based invalidation
4. Support pattern-based invalidation

### Cache Monitoring
1. Add cache metrics collection
2. Implement monitoring endpoints
3. Create health checks
4. Add performance tracking

## Current Issues
- None at the moment

## Testing Status
- All existing tests passing
- Need to add tests for new rate limiting functionality
- Need to add tests for similarity-based caching
