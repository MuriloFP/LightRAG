# SuperLightRAG - Active Context

## Current Focus
Setting up project infrastructure and documentation

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory bank structure
2. Defined implementation plan
3. Established technical requirements
4. Outlined system architecture

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Setting up project documentation
- [ ] Planning initial Rust project structure
- [ ] Researching mobile platform constraints

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Rust project with cargo
2. Set up cross-platform build configuration
3. Begin implementing JSON KV Storage

## Important Notes
- Focus on mobile compatibility from the start
- Keep memory usage minimal
- Ensure all storage components are optimized for mobile
- Document all design decisions

## Questions to Address
1. Best practices for mobile filesystem access in Rust
2. Optimal HNSW parameters for mobile vector search
3. Memory mapping strategies for petgraph on mobile
4. Efficient JSON storage patterns for mobile

## Current Blockers
None at the moment

## Today's Objectives
1. Complete initial documentation setup
2. Plan project structure
3. Research mobile platform requirements
