# Current Status
Document Processing Implementation - Text Chunking Complete

## Current Focus
Implementing text chunking functionality with tiktoken-rs integration

## Recent Changes
- Created text chunking module structure
- Implemented TextChunk and ChunkingError types
- Added tiktoken-rs integration
- Implemented core chunking functionality
- Added support for both token-based and character-based splitting
- Added comprehensive test coverage
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Current Task
Moving on to Document Format Support:
- Planning format-specific handlers
- Researching PDF and Word document processing libraries
- Designing format detection system

## Implementation Plan
1. ✓ Create chunking module structure
2. ✓ Implement core types
3. ✓ Add tiktoken integration
4. ✓ Implement chunking logic
5. ✓ Add tests
6. Next: Start Document Format Support implementation

## Test Coverage
1. ✓ Basic token-based chunking
2. ✓ Character-based splitting
3. ✓ Empty input handling
4. ✓ Error cases
5. ✓ Edge cases (large chunks, overlaps)

## Dependencies
- ✓ tiktoken-rs
- ✓ serde
- ✓ tracing

## Important Notes
- Chunking implementation matches LightRAG's functionality
- Both token-based and character-based splitting supported
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Test coverage ensures reliability
- Memory efficient implementation

## Next Steps
1. Research PDF processing libraries
2. Research Word document processing libraries
3. Design format detection system
4. Create format-specific handlers

## Known Issues
None - All chunking tests passing

## Progress
- [x] Core infrastructure setup
- [x] Text chunking implementation
- [x] Test coverage
- [ ] Document format support

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Research document processing libraries
- [ ] Design format handlers
- [ ] Create format detection system

## Important Notes
- Focus on cross-platform compatibility
- Memory usage optimization
- Mobile-friendly implementation
- All design decisions documented

## Questions to Address
1. Best PDF processing library for cross-platform use
2. Word document processing approach for mobile
3. Format detection strategy
4. Memory optimization for large documents

## Current Blockers
None at the moment
